To export the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable in your project directory, you typically want to set it in your shell or environment configuration file. Here's how you can do it for different operating systems:

### For Windows

1. **Using Command Prompt:**
   Open Command Prompt and run the following command (replace `C:\VulkanSDK\1.2.162.0` with your actual Vulkan SDK path):

   ```cmd
   set VULKAN_SDK=C:\VulkanSDK\1.2.162.0
   ```

   This will set the variable for the current session. To make it permanent, you can set it in the system environment variables.

2. **Using PowerShell:**
   Open PowerShell and run:

   ```powershell
   $env:VULKAN_SDK="C:\VulkanSDK\1.2.162.0"
   ```

3. **Permanent Environment Variable:**
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - Click on "Environment Variables."
   - Under "System variables," click "New" and enter `VULKAN_SDK` as the variable name and your Vulkan SDK path as the value.

### For macOS/Linux

1. **Bash Shell:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command (replace `/path/to/vulkan/sdk` with your actual Vulkan SDK path):

   ```bash
   export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan/sdk
   ```

   To make this change permanent, add the export command to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

   ```bash
   echo 'export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan/sdk' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Then, run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

2. **Zsh Shell:**
   If you are using Zsh, you can add the same line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

   ```bash
   echo 'export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan/sdk' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

   Then, run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

### Project-Specific Configuration

If you want to set `VULKAN_SDK` specifically for a project, you can also create a script (e.g., `setenv.sh` for Linux/macOS or `setenv.bat` for Windows) in your project directory:

- **For Linux/macOS (`setenv.sh`):**

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan/sdk
  ```

- **For Windows (`setenv.bat`):**

  ```bat
  @echo off
  set VULKAN_SDK=C:\VulkanSDK\1.2.162.0
  ```

You can then run this script to set the environment variable before building or running your project.
