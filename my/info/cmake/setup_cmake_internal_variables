In CMake, you can set internal variables such as CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR to control the C compiler that CMake uses for your project. 
Here’s how you can set these variables:

Setting CMake Compiler Variables
CMAKE_C_COMPILER: This variable specifies the C compiler to use. You can set it when invoking CMake from the command line.


CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR: This variable specifies the environment variable that CMake should check to find the C compiler.


Setting the Variables via Command Line
You can set these variables directly when you run the cmake command. Here’s an example of how to do this:

bash


mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/your/compiler -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR=YOUR_COMPILER_ENV_VAR ..
Example
Assuming you have a specific C compiler located at /usr/bin/gcc, and you want to set an environment variable named MY_CC to use this compiler, 
you could do the following:

bash


mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR=MY_CC ..
Setting Variables in CMakeLists.txt
You can also set these variables within your CMakeLists.txt file, but note that setting CMAKE_C_COMPILER directly 
in the CMakeLists.txt file is not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behavior. 
However, you can set CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR:



cmake
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR "MY_CC")
Example of Using Environment Variables
If you want to use an environment variable to specify the compiler, you can set it in your shell before running CMake:

bash


export MY_CC=/usr/bin/gcc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR=MY_CC ..
Summary
Use CMAKE_C_COMPILER to specify the C compiler directly when invoking CMake.
Use CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR to specify an environment variable that contains the path to the compiler.
Setting CMAKE_C_COMPILER in CMakeLists.txt is generally discouraged; instead, set it through the command line or environment variables.
Note
Make sure that the specified compiler is compatible with your project and that any necessary environment variables are correctly 
set before running CMake. This will ensure that CMake can find and use the specified compiler correctly.
