To discard a previous commit in Git, you have a few options depending on whether you want to keep the changes from that commit or completely discard them. Here are the most common methods:

### 1. Discard the Last Commit (Keep Changes)

If you want to undo the last commit but keep the changes in your working directory (so you can modify them or commit them again), you can use:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### 2. Discard the Last Commit (Discard Changes)

If you want to completely discard the last commit and all changes associated with it, you can use:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### 3. Discard a Specific Commit

If you want to discard a specific commit that is not the last one, you can use the `git revert` command. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit. To do this, first, find the commit hash (you can use `git log` to find it), then run:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### 4. Interactive Rebase

If you want to remove or modify multiple commits, you can use interactive rebase:

1. Start an interactive rebase for the last few commits (replace `N` with the number of commits you want to go back):

    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~N
    ```

2. In the text editor that opens, you can change the command next to the commit you want to discard from `pick` to `drop`. Save and close the editor.

### Important Notes

- **Using `git reset --hard`**: Be very careful with this command as it will permanently delete any changes in your working directory that are not committed.
- **Back Up Your Work**: If you're unsure, it's a good idea to create a backup branch before performing destructive operations:

    ```bash
    git branch backup-branch
    ```

- **Collaborative Repositories**: If you have already pushed your commits to a shared repository, be cautious about using `git reset` or `git rebase`, as these can rewrite history and may cause issues for others working on the same repository. In such cases, `git revert` is often a safer option.

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on whether you want to keep or discard changes.
