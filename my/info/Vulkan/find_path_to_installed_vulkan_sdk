To find the path to the installed Vulkan SDK, you can follow these steps based on your operating system:

### For Windows

1. **Using Environment Variables:**
   If you have installed the Vulkan SDK, it usually sets an environment variable called `VULKAN_SDK`. You can check this in Command Prompt:

   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```cmd
     echo %VULKAN_SDK%
     ```

   This command will print the path to the Vulkan SDK if it is set.

2. **Check Installation Directory:**
   The default installation path for the Vulkan SDK on Windows is typically:
   ```
   C:\VulkanSDK\<version>\
   ```
   You can navigate to `C:\VulkanSDK\` in File Explorer to see the available versions.

3. **Using the Vulkan SDK Installer:**
   If you still have the Vulkan SDK installer, you can run it again, and it will show you the installation path during the setup process.

### For macOS

1. **Using Terminal:**
   Open a terminal and check if the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set:

   ```bash
   echo $VULKAN_SDK
   ```

   If it is set, this command will return the path to the Vulkan SDK.

2. **Default Installation Path:**
   If you installed the Vulkan SDK via a package manager like Homebrew, the path is usually:
   ```
   /usr/local/vulkan
   ```

### For Linux

1. **Using Terminal:**
   Open a terminal and check the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable:

   ```bash
   echo $VULKAN_SDK
   ```

   If this variable is set, it will display the path to the Vulkan SDK.

2. **Default Installation Path:**
   If you installed the Vulkan SDK via a package manager or from the official sources, it is often located in:
   ```
   /usr/include/vulkan
   ```
   or
   ```
   /usr/local/VulkanSDK/<version>/
   ```

### Summary

If the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is not set, you may need to check the installation directories manually or refer to the documentation of the Vulkan SDK you installed. If you installed it via a package manager, you can also consult the package manager's documentation for the installation path.
