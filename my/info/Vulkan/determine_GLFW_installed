To determine if GLFW (Graphics Library Framework) is installed on your system, you can follow these steps based on your operating system:

### On Windows

1. **Check Installed Programs:**
   - Go to `Control Panel` > `Programs` > `Programs and Features`.
   - Look for GLFW in the list of installed software.

2. **Check via Command Line:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```cmd
     where glfw3.dll
     ```
   - If the command returns a path, GLFW is installed.

3. **Check in Your Development Environment:**
   - If you are using an IDE (like Visual Studio), check your project settings to see if GLFW is included in your libraries.

### On macOS

1. **Using Homebrew:**
   - If you installed GLFW via Homebrew, you can check if it’s installed by running:
     ```bash
     brew list glfw
     ```
   - If it’s installed, it will show the version.

2. **Check via Terminal:**
   - You can also check for the library file:
     ```bash
     ls /usr/local/lib/libglfw.dylib
     ```
   - If the file exists, GLFW is installed.

### On Linux

1. **Using Package Manager:**
   - For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, check with:
     ```bash
     dpkg -l | grep glfw
     ```
   - For Fedora or Red Hat-based systems, use:
     ```bash
     rpm -qa | grep glfw
     ```

2. **Check via Terminal:**
   - You can also check for the library file:
     ```bash
     ls /usr/lib/libglfw.so
     ```
   - If the file exists, GLFW is installed.

### General Method (Cross-Platform)

1. **Check in Your Project:**
   - If you have a project using GLFW, look for include statements like:
     ```c
     #include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
     ```
   - If the compiler can find this header file and link against GLFW, it is installed correctly.

2. **Try Compiling a Simple Program:**
   - Write a simple GLFW program and try to compile it. If it compiles without errors related to GLFW, it is installed.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to determine if GLFW is installed on your system. If you find that it is not installed, 
you can download it from the [GLFW website](https://www.glfw.org/) or install it using a package manager.
